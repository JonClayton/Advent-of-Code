# Advent of Code 2021

I'm using two languages that I am not fluent in since my daily work is in .NET

## Python  
I believe this is the best for coding interviews, and is definitely the lingua franca for data science, which is a big part of Arundo's business, so it would be good for me to be more fluent.
I recognize that at least initially it will not be very Pythonic and won't leverage all the capabilities of Python, especially Numpy, but I plan to learn them as the solutions push me to do so.
Until then, code will be very verbose, but should also mean the algorithms are quite transparent.

## Ruby
I used Ruby at Dev Bootcamp in 2015-16, and loved how chaining methods allowed code to be concise and super readable.
See my Sudoko Solver repo for an example.
I'm going to re-do solutions here to renew my Ruby knowledge and have more concise solutions showing off more powerful methods.
