# Advent of Code 2021

I'm using three languages. 
I will leave the reader to infer which I actually work in daily.

## Python  
My expert friends believe this is the best for coding interviews, and is definitely the lingua franca for data science, which is a big part of Arundo's business.
I recognize that at least initially it will not be very Pythonic and won't leverage all the capabilities of Python, especially Numpy, but I plan to learn them as the solutions push me to do so.
Until then, code will be very verbose, but should also mean the algorithms are quite transparent.

## Ruby
I used Ruby at Dev Bootcamp in 2015-16, and loved how chaining methods allowed code to be concise and super readable.
See my Sudoku Solver repo for an example.

## Net
This will be my first use of .NET 6.0 and C# 10.
